# StorMPY-Model
This is a model in python describing the behaviour of Tyre wear microplastics in a stormwater system on highway E-18
THe model considers two main processes Hetero-aggregation and settling in the pipes and wells. The Equations for the following can be found in the functions folder. 
The path, for the GCconstants must be provided. 
THe Excel files for the input data and shared in the input data folder. 
The results have to be taken one by one as you from the simulatar to be imported in the results module. 
It is better to temporarily comment all the functions in the results while this process is being done. 
The result file then can be run part by part to create excel files. The first two functions must be run first as is mentioned in the Resultspy file. 
After exporting files to Excel one needs to form a Combined Excel sheet ( the code for it is not written as it is easier to just copy and paste in Excel). An example sheet is presented in the Results file by the name 'Allpipes' and AllWells'. 
This two sheets can further be used for the data analysis Py file
